# LocalSimulation
This plugin allows you to essentially create PxScene or Physic Scenes by placing an Actor, and adding other Static Mesh Components and soon Skeletal Mesh components within this space. Adding Constraints, and Forces will work as expected, but now with the additional layer of abstraction so that world simulation can be associated with a transform.
